The Lowbar project involves reimplementing a JS library called Underscore as if you were the author. You'll need to reimplement the following methods:

## Core

First start with the core methods

1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains

Then move onto the advanced methods

1. once
2. memoize
3. shuffle
4. invoke
5. sortBy (NB the Underscore library uses the native JavaScript sort but feel free to use your sort algorithm!)
6. zip
7. sortedIndex
8. flatten
9. intersection
10. difference
